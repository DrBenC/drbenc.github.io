I'm a crystallographer and I love to tinker with electronics, code in Python, and I love a bit of CAD and 3D printing.

I also love Lego, climbing, Dark Souls and cycling.

Proudest achievement to date is eating an orange at the top of Blorenge not once, but twice. Would recommend the experience to a friend.
