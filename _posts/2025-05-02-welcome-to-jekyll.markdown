So, I've decided to put together a website. Mostly this is to get to grips with how GitHub webpages work, but I'm actually quite excited at the prospect!

I suspect I will update this very, very infrequently, but let's see how we go. Apparently you can put bits of code in here - that makes sense, it's GitHub! 

{% highlight python %}
def hello(name):
  print(f"Hello, {name}!")

if name != None:
  hello(name)
else:
  hello("friend")
{% endhighlight %}

Have a look at my [GitHub] if you want to see some bad code I did several years ago, or check out my [YouTube] page.
