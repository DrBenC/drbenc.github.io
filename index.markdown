I'm Ben, this is my website. I'm just using this to practise using GibHub and learn a little about markdown. Look, I included an image!

<img src="https://github.com/DrBenC/drbenc.github.io/blob/main/docs/assets/mugshot.gif?raw=true" width="150">

(Please don't use it for anything nefarious.)

Feel free to reach out to me @DrBenChem on most platforms.
